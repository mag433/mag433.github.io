  <p>SAYGE is a soul-pop trio whose tight, eclectic harmonies and vintage groove create a new contemporary sound with covers and original tunes. The Miami-based group formed in 2017 and the three unique voices have been blending to make refreshing, sophisticated music ever since. Similar to their namesake herb, SAYGE’s music exudes organic flavor far beyond its years that pairs perfectly with a nice glass of cabernet.
