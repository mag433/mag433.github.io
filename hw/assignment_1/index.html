    <h2 style="font-size: 20px">About Me</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 18px"> Matt Gagnon, from <a href="http://boston.com">Boston, Massachusetts</a>, has spent most of his life in the classical music world, where he has won state-wide and national awards for his singing, as well as for playing piano and cello. He made the switch to the contemporary world upon beginning his college career at the <a href="http://miami.edu">University of Miami</a>, where he currently studies Music Business and Contemporary Songwriting. He has now released several original songs on SoundCloud, and was featured as a soloist on BisCaydence’s latest a cappella album, titled Against the Current. He hopes to be releasing his first EP as a solo artist by December. After graduation, he plans to work in the music industry as a performer, educator, manager, or producer. </p>
